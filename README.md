# Alzheimer’s Disease Classification with Ensemble Learning: Random Forest-based Bagging Classifier

This project focuses on the classification of Alzheimer's disease using ensemble learning techniques, particularly a Random Forest-based Bagging Classifier. The dataset comprises various features related to cognitive scores, diagnostic information, and other relevant clinical data. The goal is to predict Alzheimer's diagnosis based on these features.

## Overview

Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative brain disorder that impacts memory and cognitive functions. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project leverages ensemble learning techniques, focusing on a Random Forest-based Bagging Classifier, to classify Alzheimer's disease based on diagnostic and cognitive test data.

The key objectives of this project are:
- To preprocess and clean the dataset.
- To explore and analyze feature importance.
- To build and evaluate multiple machine learning models, with a focus on Random Forest-based Bagging.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained from clinical records and contains multiple sheets:
- **Diagnosis Target**: Contains the diagnosis labels (target variable).
- **Cognitive Score**: Cognitive test scores that serve as predictors.
- **Data**: Other clinical data related to patients' health metrics.

The dataset is stored in an Excel file with multiple sheets and is preprocessed before training models.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need to install the required dependencies.

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Alzheimer-s-disease-Classification-with-Ensemble-Learning-Random-Forest-based-Bagging-Classifier.git
cd Alzheimer-s-disease-Classification-with-Ensemble-Learning-Random-Forest-based-Bagging-Classifier

### Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: The project uses Python 3.x.

### Usage
Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Alzheimer_disease_Classification.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and train machine learning models.

## Modeling Approach
The project applies several machine learning models, focusing on ensemble learning, to classify Alzheimer's disease:

- Random Forest-based Bagging Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
The steps include:
- Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- Model Training:
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train various classification models, with an emphasis on Random Forest-based Bagging, and tune hyperparameters.
- Evaluation:
Models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
## Results
The project compares the performance of different models and selects the best-performing one for Alzheimer's classification. The results are visualized using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and other performance metrics.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve the model, fix bugs, or add new features, please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
